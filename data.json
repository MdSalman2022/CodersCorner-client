    "title": "Picking a CMS in 2023",
    "description": "If you are working on any kind of public-facing digital project — no matter if it’s a website, a web app, a mobile app or desktop app — you will likely need a Content Management System. There are a lot of options to chose from, and different solutions are better suited for some needs than others. We can distinguish some categories straight away: General purpose or web oriented Headless or traditional. By access to data APIs (GraphQL, REST, SDKs) Cloud based or self-hosted General purpose or web oriented The first thing to consider is whether you need a general purpose CMS or a web-oriented one. A general purpose CMS is a tool that can be used to manage content for any kind of project (apps, desktop, web), while a web-oriented CMS is a tool that is designed to manage content for websites. Web oriented CMSs are built with the assumption that the content will be displayed on a website, and they usually provide a web editor to edit the content. This is not the case for general purpose CMSs, which can be used to manage content for any kind of project, including mobile apps, desktop apps, etc. Web oriented CMSs are usually simpler to use, but they are also more limited in terms of features and integrations. They provide built-in support for pages, headers, footers, navigation menus, and other common website features, but they are not as flexible as general purpose CMSs. Also, they will typically have a `published` flag (or equivalent) for each entity. Of course, nothing stops you from using a general purpose CMS to manage content for a website, and replicate the published system. Do you need a blog? A web-oriented CMS will likely have a built-in blog solution, while a general purpose CMS will not. Examples of web-oriented CMSs are Wordpress, Drupal, Prismic or Storyblok.Those are the way to go if your main goal is to build a website and will usually provide templates to get started. They might not be the best option if you are planning to build apps or multiple websites with the same content. Headless or traditional. Traditional CMSs are the ones that provide a web editor to edit the content, and they will be responsible for rendering it on the website. So the admin interface and the website are tightly coupled. Headless CMSs are the opposite: they are not coupled to the rendering of the website and are in charge of managing the content exclusively. CMS and website are different software components in this case. They provide an API to access the content. The website is responsible for rendering the content, and it can be built with any technology. Conclusion, Picking a CMS is a very personal decision, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. You should consider your team’s experience, the project’s requirements and your budget! At FireCMS we are happy to help if you need a CMS that is flexible and can be customised to your needs.

    "title": "12 React Hooks Every React Developer Should Know",
    "description": "What is Socket.IO ?? Intraditional HTTP servers, when client requests for the resource then and then only the server responds. Server can not respond to user if new data is available. Disadvantage of these servers is user have to request again and again continuously in order to get new data. This increases load on server as well as user is also frustrated. Web Socket is a communication protocol which provides a full-duplex and low-latency channel between the server and the browser. It is used to implement connection between server and client such that server can also respond to client if new data is available or the old data is updated. Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. We can connect client and server responding to each other using socket.io. BUT Socket.IO is NOT a WebSocket implementation. Socket.IO uses WebSocket as a transport when possible, but it adds additional metadata to each packet. Due to this WebSocket client will not be able to successfully connect to a Socket.IO server, and a Socket.IO client will not be able to connect to a plain WebSocket server either. Features that socket.io provides over traditional WebSockets Reliability. Automatic Reconnection. Acknowledgments.Broadcasting to all clients or to a subset of clients (similar to Group chats).npm initSpecify some application specifications there or you can press `Enter` key and keep skipping them and keeping them as default value. Also install express and socket.io using following commands: npm install express npm install socket.io Initializing Server in Index.js Create a new file namely index.js and import some requirements. const express = require(‘express’) // Importing Express const app = express() // Creating Express Server const host = ‘localhost’ // Specifying Host const port = 8000 // Specifying Port number// Creating Http Server from Express App to work with .io const http = require(‘http’).Server(app);// Initializing socket.io object const io = require(‘socket.io’)(http,{ // Specifying CORS  cors: { origin: `*`, } }) Here in the first line we are importing express library in order to create an express server in Node JS. In second line we are creating an express app using express(). Then we are specifying our host and port number. In normal express apps you usually wont create http server object. But inorder to work with socket.io we need to create instance of http server from express app. You can  express app’s methods like .get() and .post() to listen to different endpoints.",

    "title": "How to upload and preview images in React.JS",
    "description": "In this article we are going to be covering how to allow a user to upload images to your application, and then how we can preview those images on your application. This foundation will also allow you to do more complicated tasks, as you will have access to the images and can send them to your services on the backend, or manipulate them on the front-end.A breakdown of the snippet aboveSo the code above should look mostly familiar, but let’s walk through it before we move to the next step.In our render function we need to set up an <input> tag for our user to interact with.<input type=file multiple accept=image onChange={onImageChange} />*/ We are setting an input with the type of file, and multi accept set to any image type, so a user can upload multiple images. And on upload it will run our handler function we have called onImageChange. And finally our handler function onImageChange is very simple, we are accessing the files through the object and then storing them in our state.A breakdown of the snippet above.So in the snippet above we have kept the same code from the last snippet and added onto it. You can separate this logic into its own component, the main thing is that is should utilize the useEffect hook on change of the images. So looking through this, it should again be mostly familiar with one exception. URL is a standard object in Javascript and it has an awesome method on it called createObjectURL. This method takes in an image object and then returns a string of a temporary local source for that image. Please note, on page reload or on re-render these strings will have to be re-built. Okay now that we have cleared up that awesome method, the rest of the code is pretty simple. We are using the useEffect hook to look for changes in our images array, and when it detects a change first we want to see if there are images to convert into strings. // You can have dynamic bounds, for instance if you have a cap if (images.length < 1 || images.length > yourCap) return; And then if there are images within your bounds we are going to start adding them to a temporary array to collect those URL strings. images.forEach(image => newImageURLs.push(URL.createObjectURL(image)));And then finally we just use a simple map function to render them to the user!{ imageURLs.map(imageSrc => <img src={imageSrc} />) }And thats really all there is to it! Thanks for reading and I hope this gives you a good start to working with user uploaded images in React.JS.",

    "title": "Top 7 mistakes that React developers make",
    "description": " At the beginning of a career, each newbie has to overcome troubles and obstacles. React developers are no exception here because their field is difficult and it seems rather hard to avoid mistakes at the very start. We have consulted our middle and senior React developers about the mistakes that juniors and trainees make. So, this time let’s turn out attention to the top mistakes that React developers make. Absence of micro-services One of the most common mistakes of newbies is putting everything in one single file. In that way, they create a monolith structure of an app that is difficult to debug and handle because everything is in one place. The best way to avoid it and reduce the pains of developers that will deal with such a code in the future is to create separate components. These components can be imported into one place later and create a necessary page for an app. Moreover, when everything is split into separate components you will be able to debug and change everything in them in the most harmless way.Direct modification of states.By design, all states in React are to be immutable. The mutation of states, objects, and arrays is a dangerous thing because it can lead to serious performance issues that will be hard to fix. React is not able to observe and commence re-rendering of the elements that have been changed but still have the same reference. The most suitable way to fix that is to apply a useState() hook or just use setState() method. That will help React to identify your changes and allow DOM to re-render them correctly. String instead of a number as the argument.To be honest, it is a trivial mistake that a lot of developers make. But it should be understood that such a tiny mistake causes a lot of trouble in the future. For example, a component or function is meant to have a number as a prop, but it receives a string. Sure thing that will lead to an error because another data type is expected. setState() is asynchronous.To be honest, sometimes even experienced developers forget about it, so no wonder a newbie does the same. What does it mean — asynchronous? That means that all the changes you provide won’t be displayed at the same time. They’d rather transfer to another render and then can be seen. Also, React will auto-batch the update calls and improve performance with it. As a result, if you forget about setState and its asynchrony, you’ll definitely receive bad results when trying to access a state value.Sure thing, you can fix that. All you need is to pass an optional second parameter to setState(). It will work as a callback and be called after each change you provide. Concluding We are all human beings and making mistakes is fine for everyone. The main thing, especially for a developer is to learn from them and tend to remove them to level up the quality of work. Look at our list, consider what mistakes you do, and try to avoid them in the ways we have represented to you.",
